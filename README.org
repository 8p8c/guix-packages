I use this repository to keep package definition for guix.

These package are :
- experiments that might later get into the official repository (and
  there for be deleted here)
- modified versions of existing package definitions for specific purposes
- non-free software I desperately need for some reasons aka can't buy
  a new computer, rewrite every piece of non-free software in the
  world but still need it sorry RMS :(
